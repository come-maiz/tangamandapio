At Zeppelin we help to protect the core infrastructure of open and
decentralized applications. My team is in charge of the
[security audits](https://zeppelin.solutions/security-audits/),
we review tons of lines of code written by very smart developers for projects
that will shake the very foundations of our society.

Finding security vulnerabilities on this futuristic cypherpunk environment is
super challenging and fun; but I think that security actually starts in a
pretty boring and traditional place, full of the wisdom that our elders have
collected through millennia of developing free software in community. So here I
want to share our checklist for boring quality things to do before spending
thousands of dollars in an audit by an external team.

âœ… Choose a free software license

Closed code is insecure. If the people using your project can't inspect it,
study it, hack and experiment on it, there's no way it can be trusted. If you
hold abusive control over your users, there's nothing stopping you (or somebody
more powerful than you) from making them vulnerable.

Take a look at the
[Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
and start by [choosing the license](https://choosealicense.com/) that better
suits your objectives.
