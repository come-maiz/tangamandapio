<p>At <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> we help protect the core
infrastructure of open and decentralized applications. I'm part of the Research
team, which is in charge of conducting
<a href="https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/">security audits</a>.
We review tons of lines of code written by very smart developers for projects
that will shake the foundations of our society.</p>
<p>Finding security vulnerabilities in this futuristic cypherpunk environment is
super challenging and fun, but
<a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/">we have already covered those topics elsewhere</a>.
I think that security actually starts in a
pretty boring and traditional place, full of the wisdom that our elders have
collected through millennia of developing software in community. Standing on
their shoulders, I want to share our checklist for basic quality measures
that your next awesome project should consider before you hand it over for an
external audit.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Choose a free software license</h2>
<p>Closed code is inherently insecure. If people who use your project can't inspect it,
study it, hack it, and experiment on it, there's no way it can be trusted. If you
hold abusive control over your users, nothing prevents you (or anyone
more powerful than you) from making them vulnerable.</p>
<p>Take a look at the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free Software Definition</a>,
and begin with <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosing the license</a> that best
suits your needs.</p>
<p><em>Update: previously we introduced here Richard Stallman as a wise elder, dressed as a saint ü§¶. 
This joke no longer seems appropriate due to his repeated 
bad comments, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Controversy_and_resignation_from_MIT_and_Free_Software_Foundation">brought to light by a recent controversy</a>.
Let's just say that we thank him for having hacked copyright laws, for starting the free software movement, and 
for writing the above definition. And that we consider appropriate him stepping down from his
leadership position in the free software community.</em></p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Build your core team of maintainers</h2>
<p>When your project succeeds, hundreds of external contributors will surely be supporting it. But in order to
get to that point, you'll need to bootstrap with a strong and diverse team of core
maintainers. They'll take care of the bulk of the work, the fun and the boring
parts, proposing and reviewing the code of your shared project. Together,
you all need to have strong knowledge of all points on this checklist.
Look not only for technical knowledge, but also for a knack for cat-herding and a
healthy work style‚Äîbecause, well, things will get complicated.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>:
make sure your team members are sharing their expertise, the lessons learned, and their
responsibilities, while at the same time constantly mentoring new people
that could potentially join the core team.</p>
<p>And somebody will have to lead and orchestrate in order to get value out of the eternal
tendency toward chaos. Let me introduce you to the magician,
<a href="http://www.camilletalk.com/">Camille Fournier</a>, who wrote THE book on technical
management,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path">The Manager's Path</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.camilletalk.com/contact/"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56bf8b0622482edc3dc1919d/t/56bf8ef5f85082335f63196b/1455400011874/21793992240_b56cd4b3e2_o+%281%29.jpg?format=500w" alt="Camille Fournier" height="350"></a></p>
<p>Camille Fournier (Image taken from
<a href="http://www.camilletalk.com/contact/">her website</a>)</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Write clean code</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/">The only valid measurement of code quality is WTFs per minute</a>. This point <em>must</em> be simple. If things get overly complicated or
weird, you're doing it wrong. Go for a walk and try again with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>But don't get me wrong: no interesting software project is simple. Add the
complexity dimensions of decentralization, transparency, cryptography, and all
these shiny ideas that are keeping us so busy these days. It's complicated by
design. But with the correct abstractions, a well thought-out model, and proper encapsulation,
you can start building the bank-killer app one line at a time. And each of
those lines <em>must</em> be clean and readable.</p>
<p>I'm not a spectacular programmer, I was just lucky to find Uncle Bob
Martin's book
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code">Clean Code</a> at
the right moment and to have read a never-ending stream of very, very ugly code.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin#/media/File:Robert_Cecil_Martin.png"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Robert_Cecil_Martin.png/800px-Robert_Cecil_Martin.png" alt="Robert C. Martin" height="250"></a></p>
<p>Robert Cecil Martin (Image taken from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin#/media/File:Robert_Cecil_Martin.png">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Once all core maintainers reach common ground on this topic, you should
enforce a consistent code style by running a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linter</a> on every new line of
code that's added. The particular rules aren't as important as
following them strictly is, but if you can
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/issues/1396#issuecomment-440426310">sacrifice your peculiar preferences to be consistent with the rest of the world</a>, your contributors will appreciate it a lot.</p>
<p>I also practice slow-food... er, slow programming.
Take your time, enjoy the journey to mastering this craft, and when you've built something you can
proudly set free, let the masses read it and judge it.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Write unit tests</h2>
<p>Write unit tests. Tons of them. 100% coverage. This might sound extreme, but hey, your code is now
playing directly with somebody else's money. If you forget, or just get lazy and
don't write a test for that super obvious line of code, you might be leaving an open
door for an exploit later in the game that will make your project crash, and
all this magic internet money will disappear in no time. It <em>has</em> happened.</p>
<p>I feel immediately more secure when I do test-driven development. At least give
an honest try to writing the tests first, and get into a cycle of
red-green-refactor. There are other techniques that can achieve the same
result, but I suggest starting there and then deviating if you find good
reasons to do so. Never worked this way? Read
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development">Test Driven Development: By Example</a>
by Kent Beck. It's a quick read that will help you avoid the temptation of
just jumping into code without thinking it through.</p>
<p>Then, even if you design for testability, you'll find many scenarios that are
hard to test. Gerard Meszaros provides all the answers in
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337302.xUnit_Test_Patterns">xUnit Test Patterns</a>.
This book is huge, so I recommend choosing a designated test expert on your
team.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck#/media/File:Kent_Beck_1.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Kent_Beck_1.jpg" alt="Kent Beck" height="350"></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gerardmes"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/71233259/Gerard_in_Vancouver__Brian_Foote-O-O_Canada_012_.jpg" alt="Gerard Meszaros" height="350"></a></p>

<p>Finally, make sure to run your unit tests on every single pull request, and make sure
they're <em>all</em> green before merging the changes. In addition, you can set up a
test coverage report to ensure that test coverage never goes down.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Test early, test often, test agile</h2>
<p>Now that you have your first layer of tests covered with tons of unit tests,
what comes next is...more tests! You need to test the integration between
all of your components, then go one level higher to test your
application from the point of view of a real user, and then go even
higher to test the interactions with other systems end-to-end.</p>
<p>To me, this is the biggest challenge, and designing a good process that
keeps many bugs out of your system can be as difficult as designing the system
itself. Iterate, automate as much as possible, share the load of manual
testing...and let your community help.</p>
<p>We'll talk later about community, but I think this is the reason for
publishing your code as early as possible: you can get help from early adopters
and enthusiasts to validate your system, not only for correctness but also to
verify that you're focusing on the right user stories and that you're tackling a
real problem with a user-friendly solution.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about iterative development processes that deliver
functionalities in progressive sprints and milestones. I found Mike Cohn's
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6707987-succeeding-with-agile">Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum</a>
a good place to start, but keep in mind that any methodology will have to be
adjusted to your team, your users, and your context. There are a lot fewer
resources focused on the quality and testing part; that's why I was so happy
when I read
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5341009-agile-testing">Agile Testing</a> by
Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, which is full of good ideas and advice. But
let me stress again: nothing you read will perfectly fit your project, so take your
time to design the testing process with as much love and care as you use when
designing the system's architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cohn#/media/File:Mike_Cohn_2013-06-12.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Mike_Cohn_2013-06-12.jpg/1280px-Mike_Cohn_2013-06-12.jpg" alt="Mike Cohn" height="350"></a> <a href="https://agiletester.ca/about-the-authors/"><img src="https://agiletester.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2013/09/Lisa-Crispin-and-Janet-Gregory.jpg" alt="Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory" height="350"></a></p>

<p>While there's still some debate about the perfect moment for auditing a project (i.e, before or after the code is
published), I think audits should be performed when there's a release candidate
ready to be deployed to mainnet, after you have performed extensive alpha and
beta testing. I see room for auditing before the code has been published,
but in this case, the audit would be more related to checking that the development
process will lead to a high-quality, properly tested release candidate and
validating the bases of your project than to performing a deep and thorough
inspection of the codebase.</p>
<p>However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to wait until the end of a long
development phase to prepare for a release and audit. Once you start writing and
testing clean code in incremental iterations, it becomes easier to think about
your complex system. Many smaller independent parts will start to pop up, which
can be extracted, generalized, and packaged for reuse, reducing anxiety for
developers and auditors. These packages are the focus of
<a href="https://zeppelinos.org/">ZeppelinOS</a> for this year, to know more take a look at
the <a href="https://blog.zeppelinos.org/state-of-evm-packages-end-of-2018/">State of EVM Packages</a>.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Write documentation</h2>
<p>This is my least favorite part, by far. So let's keep it simple, starting at
the beginning: the README, the most important file of your repository.
And yet, it's usually either empty or bloated, outdated, and ugly. Ideally, as it's the
first thing developers and potential contributors will read, it should work as a clear, straightforward index of
your project.</p>
<p>It's best not to get creative here. Just follow this simple specification that
works for all cases, proposed by Richard Littauer in
<a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md">Standard Readme</a>.
<em>Do not forget</em> to include a specific section in the main README that states how people should disclose any security
vulnerabilities found in your project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/richlitt"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/853672023511490561/m_RAvJfy.jpg" alt="Richard Littauer" height="350"></a></p>
<p>Richard Littauer (Image taken from <a href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">Twitter</a>)</p>
<p>Next come the docstrings, the documentation inside your code files. We hit
an apparent conflict here, since in theory, if your code is clean,
it will not require documentation. However, note that we are no longer
designing standalone systems that work as a black box. We are building
protocols for decentralized applications, and your code will be called by all sorts
of external agents. So by all means, document every function that's part
of the contract's public API, following the
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format">NatSpec format</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next point. I highly recommend that you document the
specification of your protocol‚Äîthat's how others will know what to call and
what to expect. But more related to the topic at hand, in an audit, we check that
the implemented code works as intended by the specification. That's why this
document is a <em>must</em>: without it, auditors will just guess at your intentions, which
might result in some issues getting missed because they're completely consistent
within the system but take it to a state that you want to avoid.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the user documentation. For high-quality systems,
writing the user documentation should be mostly painless. The moment things get cumbersome
while documenting, consider re-evaluating your user stories, and don't be afraid to go back to iterate on
them.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Check your dependencies</h2>
<p>Your project builds on top of many, many others. It will probably depend at least
on the Ethereum protocol and its network of nodes, and on Solidity, a bunch of
Ethereum Improvement Proposals and their implementation, libraries for testing and UI, and maybe hundreds
of other small projects. Even if yours is secure, you need to check how healthy your dependencies are,
since they can easily become the source of
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that your team should have strong and diverse knowledge.
That includes knowledge of all the projects that surround you. You should be able to
write idiomatic code following the best practices of the language, to identify
and avoid known issues, always keeping an eye on new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVEs</a>
that may directly (or indirectly, through third-party dependencies) affect your project. Moreover, try to participate in the communities around your
dependencies, as it's an excellent way to see firsthand how safe and trustworthy they are.
You should also consider <em>actively</em> participating in those communities, to gain some karma that will surely come in
handy later when you need new features and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Moreover, don't forget to pay attention to your dependencies' finances. When making your project's budget,
take into account a share for your dependencies, as they may need it in order
to remain actively maintained. There's a very nice project called
<a href="https://opencollective.com/discover">OpenCollective</a>,
led by Pia Mancini, which is making it extremely easy to transparently support
the organizations and developers you depend on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.piamancini.com/"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7bdaa_ab650ff17e804731b7cf560bc5ee9a02~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_120,w_961,h_961/fill/w_530,h_530,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/Pia%20Mancini%20-%20headshot.jpg" alt="Pia Mancini" height="350"></a></p>
<p>Pia Mancini (Image taken from her <a href="https://www.piamancini.com/">website</a>)</p>
<p>And, of course, with <a href="https://zeppelinos.org/">ZeppelinOS</a>, we're building a
platform that will let you vouch for the security of a package. It's in beta
testing, so expect exciting news very soon.</p>
<p>Specific to Ethereum and Solidity, the community is collecting the lessons
learned (usually in a painful way). You can learn a lot about interesting
and tricky vulnerabilities playing the
<a href="https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/">Ethernaut capture-the-flag game</a>.
We've
<a href="https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/security">published many of our past audits</a>
with descriptions of the issues found, recommendations, and usually a link
to the patch that fixes them. All of our learnings from audits are distilled into
the <a href="https://openzeppelin.org/">OpenZeppelin package</a>, which you should definitely add
to your list of dependencies‚Äîif you're not one of the thousands that already did. The
<a href="https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/">Smart Contracts Weakness Registry</a>
maintained by the Mythril team is also a great resource for learning from the
experience of others.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take, remember that as the Ethereum space is very young and unexplored, we're learning many things as we go, so <em>always</em>
proceed with caution.</p>
<h2>‚úîÔ∏è Build your community</h2>
<p>This is a complement to the first point: code without a community is insecure.
The community gives you eyes to monitor the project, hands to test it in a
real environment, support to survive challenging problems, and resilience to
adjust to the unexpected. No amount of money, experience, or knowledge
can substitute for this.</p>
<p>Once you publish the code, you can get started engaging your community. If your
project is interesting, they will come, and this is where the cat-herding
abilities of your team will shine. However, you definitely need to set up proper and fluent communication channels,
invest in some marketing, and hire a bold community manager with a plan to disentangle
and wisely leverage all the opportunities your community brings. I can't
recommend highly enough the writings and videos by
<a href="https://www.jonobacon.com/">Jono Bacon</a>, who has covered all the topics you
can imagine about community management.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonobacon/12622356185/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3740/12622356185_b89d134675_k.jpg" alt="Jono Bacon" height="350"></a></p>
<p>Jono Bacon in 2014 (Image taken from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonobacon/12622356185/">Flickr</a>)</p>
<p>You should be thoughtful and caring with your community. A small step that
goes a long way is to adopt and enforce a
<a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">code of conduct</a> so you can all feel
safe. Then, write some contribution guidelines to make sure that all of their
enthusiasm can be put to good use and they don't get lost. Lastly, think about
setting up a <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">bug bounty program</a> that will
encourage your community to watch out for vulnerabilities in the wild,
providing hackers with enough incentives to disclose security issues in a responsible way.</p>

<p>On 2017 we saw a mind-blowing number of crowdsales and ICOs running in the
Ethereum blockchain. They have proven to be a
powerful tool to collect the funds required to start a project, and they are
one of the most common uses for smart contracts right now. The Zeppelin team
has been very involved in this topic,
<a href="https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/audit">auditing many crowdsale contracts</a>,
and supporting <a href="https://openzeppelin.org/">OpenZeppelin</a>, the most popular
framework to build these crowdsales. What we found was a lot of contracts
repeating the same basic concepts, with very similar code, and common
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, part of the team took the task to redesign our base
<code>Crowdsale</code> contract in order to support a lot of new crowdsale flavors out of
the box and to make the experience of building and publishing your own
crowdsale more clear and secure. The idea is to make audits less necessary,
with an architecture that is modular, that encourages reuse and that will be
collectively reviewed. These new contracts were added to OpenZeppelin version
<code>1.7.0</code>, and since the release they have been widely used by our community with
 great success. So, this is a good moment to show off :)</p>
<p>Let's start with a dive into
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol">the source code of the <code>Crowdsale</code> base contract</a>.
The first thing you will notice is a lot of comments, guiding you through the
details of the OpenZeppelin crowdsale architecture. They explain that some
functions are the core of the architecture and should not be overriden, like
<code>buyTokens</code>. Some others like <code>_preValidatePurchase</code> can be overriden to
implement the requirements of your crowdsale, but that extra behavior should
be concatenated with the one of the parent by calling <code>super</code>, to preserve the
validations from the  base contract. Some functions like
<code>_postValidatePurchase</code> can be just added as hooks in other parts of the
crowdsale's lifecycle.</p>
<p>Building on top of this base, we now provide some contracts for common
crowdsale scenarios involving
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/crowdsale/distribution">distribution</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/crowdsale/emission">emission</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/crowdsale/price">price</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/crowdsale/validation">validation</a>.</p>
<p>So, let's say that you want to set a goal for your crowdsale and if it's not
met by the time the sale finishes, you want to refund all your investors. For
that, you can use the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/RefundableCrowdsale.sol">RefundableCrowdsale contract</a>,
which overrides the base <code>_forwardFunds</code> behavior to send the funds to a fancy
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/utils/RefundVault.sol">RefundVault</a>
while the crowdsale is in progress, instead of sending them directly to the
wallet of the crowdsale owner.</p>
<p>Another common scenario is when you want the tokens to be minted when they are
purchased. For that, take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/crowdsale/emission/MintedCrowdsale.sol">MintedCrowdsale contract</a>,
which overrides the simple <code>_deliverTokens</code> behavior of the base class to call
instead the <code>mint</code> function of an
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/MintableToken.sol">ERC20 Mintable token</a>.</p>
<p>What if we want to do something more interesting with the price of the tokens?
The base <code>Crowdsale</code> contract defines a constant rate between tokens and wei,
but if we override <code>_getTokenAmount</code>, we could do something like increasing
the price as the closing time of the crowdsale approaches. That's exactly what
the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/crowdsale/price/IncreasingPriceCrowdsale.sol">IncreasingPriceCrowdsale contract</a>
does.</p>
<p>To get started developing and deploying a crowdsale using the OpenZeppelin
framework, Gustavo Guimaraes published a nice
<a href="https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/how-to-create-token-and-initial-coin-offering-contracts-using-truffle-openzeppelin-1b7a5dae99b6">guide where you will see in action a crowdsale that is timed <strong>and</strong> minted</a>.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples. I invite you to explore the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/crowdsale">OpenZeppelin crowdsale contracts</a>
to see all the new flavors that you can easily use to fund your cool idea;
and take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/examples/SampleCrowdsale.sol">SampleCrowdsale contract</a>,
a more complex scenario that comes with full
<a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/test/examples/SampleCrowdsale.test.js">test coverage</a>.
If you like OpenZeppelin, remember that you are welcome into
<a href="https://slack.openzeppelin.org/">our vibrating community</a> to help us adding new
contracts or improving the existing ones.</p>
<p>On the repo you will also find that all these contracts are very well tested. And
as we have seen, the new architecture is clearer and safer, with each contract
explaining the functions that you can or can't override, and how to do it.
However, you should be extra careful when combining them. It's not the same to
have three contracts with one condition than to have one contract with three
conditions. The combination increases the attack surface, so you need to have
a good idea of what you want to achieve, and know the implementation details of
the tools you are using.</p>
<p>Before you go ahead and deploy a complex crowdsale that combines some of our
contracts, I would like to spend some time going deep into how Solidity works
when you combine contracts through multiple inheritance, like Gustavo did in
his guide to make a contract that inherits from <code>TimedCrowdsale</code> <strong>and</strong> from
<code>MintedCrowdsale</code>.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is hard, and it can get very confusing if you abuse it.
Some languages don't support it at all; but it is becoming a very common
pattern on Solidity.</p>
<p>The problem, from the point of view of the programmer, is to understand the
order of the calls when a contract has multiple parents. Let's say we have a
base contract <code>A</code>, with a function named <code>f</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">contract A {</span>
<span class="err">  function f() {</span>
<span class="err">    somethingA();</span>
<span class="err">  }</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre>


<p>Then we have two contracts <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, both inherit from <code>A</code> and override <code>f</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">contract</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">{</span>
  <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">somethingB</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

<span class="n">contract</span> <span class="k">C</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="err">{</span>
  <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">somethingC</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre>


<p>And finaly we have a contract <code>D</code>, which inherits from <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, and
overrides <code>f</code> too:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">contract D is B, C {</span>
<span class="err">  function f() {</span>
<span class="err">    somethingD();</span>
<span class="err">    super.f();</span>
<span class="err">  }</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre>


<p>What happens when you call <code>D.f</code>?</p>
<p>This is called the diamond problem, because we end up with a diamond-shaped
inheritance diagram:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Diamond_inheritance.svg/180px-Diamond_inheritance.svg.png"><img alt="Diamond inheritance problem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Diamond_inheritance.svg/180px-Diamond_inheritance.svg.png"></a></p>
<p>(the image is from wikipedia)</p>
<p>To solve it, Solidity uses C3 linearization, also called Method Resolution
Order (MRO). This means that it will linearize the inheritance graph. If <code>D</code>
is defined as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">contract D is B, C {}</span>
</pre>


<p>then <code>D.f</code> will call:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">somethingD();</span>
<span class="err">somethingC();</span>
<span class="err">somethingB();</span>
<span class="err">somethingA();</span>
</pre>


<p>When <code>D</code> inherits from <code>B, C</code>, the linearization results in D‚Üí C‚Üí B‚Üí A. This
means that <code>super</code> on <code>D</code> calls <code>C</code>. And you might be a little surprised by the
fact that calling <code>super</code> on <code>C</code> will result on a call to <code>B</code> instead of <code>A</code>,
even though <code>C</code> doesn't inherit from <code>B</code>. Finally, <code>super</code> on <code>B</code> will call
<code>A</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>D</code> is instead defined as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">contract D is C, B {}</span>
</pre>


<p>then <code>D.f</code> will call:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">somethingD();</span>
<span class="err">somethingB();</span>
<span class="err">somethingC();</span>
<span class="err">somethingA();</span>
</pre>


<p>When <code>D</code> inherits from <code>C, B</code>, the linearization results in D‚Üí B‚Üí C‚Üí A.</p>
<p>Notice here that the order in which you declare the parent contracts matters a
lot. If the inheritance graph is not too complex, it will be easy to see that
the order of calls will follow the order in which the parents were declared,
right to left. If your inheritance is more complicated than this and the
hierarchy is not very clear, you should probably stop using multiple
inheritance and look for an alternate solution.</p>
<p>I recommend you to read the wikipedia pages of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">Multiple inheritance</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization">C3 linearization</a>, and the
<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization">Solidity docs about multiple inheritance</a>.
You will find in there a complete explanation of the C3 algorithm, and an
example with a more complicated inheritance graph.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can impact your crowdsales, take a look at the
case that Philip Daian brilliantly explains on his blog post
<a href="https://pdaian.com/blog/solidity-anti-patterns-fun-with-inheritance-dag-abuse/">Solidity anti-patterns: Fun with inheritance DAG abuse</a>.
There, he presents a Crowdsale contract that needs "to have a whitelist
pool of preferred investors able to buy in the pre-sale [...], along with a
hard cap of the number of [...] tokens that can be distributed." On his first
(deliberately) faulty implementation, he ends up with a crowdsale that checks:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">((withinPeriod &amp;&amp; nonZeroPurchase) &amp;&amp; withinCap) || (whitelist[msg.sender] &amp;&amp; !hasEnded())</span>
</pre>


<p>Pay close attention to the resulting condition, and notice that if a
whitelisted investor buys tokens before the crowdsale has ended, she will be
able to bypass the hard cap, and buy as many tokens as she wants.</p>
<p>By just inverting the order on which the parents are defined, he fixes the
contract which will now check for:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">(withinPeriod &amp;&amp; nonZeroPurchase || (whitelist[msg.sender] &amp;&amp; !hasEnded())) &amp;&amp; withinCap</span>
</pre>


<p>Now, if the purchase attempt goes above the cap, the transaction will be
reverted even if the sender is whitelisted.</p>
<p>There are some simple cases, where the order of the conditions is not
important. By now, you should have started to suspect that the contract above
became complicated because of the <code>||</code> (<em>or</em>) condition. Things are a lot easier
when all our conditions are merged with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (<em>and</em>), because in that case the
order of the conditions doesn't alter the result.</p>
<p>Our new architecture was crafted for using <code>require</code> instead of returning
booleans, which works nicely to combine <em>and</em> conditions, and to revert the
transaction when one fails. Let's say that we have a crowdsale that should
<strong>only</strong> allow whitelisted investors to buy tokens while the sale is open
<strong>and</strong> the cap has not been reached. In this
case, the condition to check would be (in pseudocode):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">require(hasStarted() &amp;&amp; !hasEnded())</span>
<span class="err">require(isInWhiteList(msg.sender))</span>
<span class="err">require(isWithinCap(msg.value))</span>
</pre>


<p>Our contract would be as simple as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">pragma</span> <span class="n">solidity</span> <span class="o">^</span><span class="mf">0.4</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>


<p>It doesn't matter how you order the parents, all the conditions will be
checked always. But take this with a grain of salt. All the conditions will be
checked, but the order will be different. This can have different side-effects
on Solidity, as some paths will execute statements that other paths won't, and
it could lead an attacker to find a specific path that is vulnerable. Also, if
your parent contracts are not super clear, they might be hiding an <code>||</code>
condition in a few hard-to-read code statements.</p>
<p>It's very easy to think that the parent contracts will just be magically merged
into something that will make sense for our use case, or to make a mistake when
we linearize them in our mind. Every use case will be different, so our
framework can't save you from the work of organizing your contracts' hierarchy.
You must analyze the linearization of the inheritance graph to get a clear view
of the functions that will be called and their order, and always always add a
full suite of automated tests for your final crowdsale contract to make sure
that it enforces all the conditions.</p>
<p>To finish, I wanted to show you my repo where I will be doing
experiments with crowdsales and their tests:
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/zeppelin-crowdsales">https://github.com/elopio/zeppelin-crowdsales</a></p>

using <code>super</code>:</p>

<p>I encourage you to join me on these experiments, to try different combinations
of crowdsales and to play switching the order of the inheritance graph. We will
learn more about the resulting code that Solidity compiles, we will improve our
mental picture of the execution stack, and we will practice writing tests
that fully cover all the possible paths. If you have questions, find
errors on the implementations in OpenZeppelin, or find an alternative
implementation that will make it easier to develop crowdsales on top of our
contracts, please
<a href="https://slack.openzeppelin.org/">let us know by sending a message to the slack channel</a>.
I am <em>elopio</em> in there.</p>
<p>A relevant experiment here is to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance#Benefits">composition over inheritance</a>.
In OpenZeppelin we couldn't implement an architecture based on composition
because of the high gas costs implied, especially during deployment. That is
one of the reasons we are now hard at work
on <a href="https://zeppelinos.org/">zeppelin_os</a>, which minimizes deployment costs
by helping you use libraries that are already on-chain. Expect exciting news
very soon!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot to <a href="https://github.com/ajsantander">Ale</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/fiiiu">Alejo</a>, who worked on these new contracts and helped
me to understand them. &lt;3</p>

y fiesta de lluvias.<br>
Hay d√≠as que no la veo,<br>
la habito como la casa propia<br>
que a veces no se siente.<br>
Otros d√≠as se me hace silencio<br>
y me agobia<br>
con su mecanismo de cosa conocida.  </p>
<p>Desde el avi√≥n es continente<br>
y de regreso rinc√≥n dulce.<br>
Dicen que somos mediocres<br>
porque aqu√≠ todo es suave,<br>
pasan cosas poco interesantes,<br>
un crimen pasional duerme en las calles,<br>
un chisme interrumpe esquinas,<br>
una an√©cdota deshace prestigios<br>
y una democracia de votos y libertades<br>
navega sobre dependencias.<br>
Somos pobres con terror de pobrezas<br>
y a veces somos ricos en sue√±os,<br>
cada uno quiere casa y parcela,<br>
nombre y renombre f√°ciles,<br>
cada quien ambiciona aire,<br>
cielo azul y patria con pan<br>
y algo m√°s por si acaso.<br>
No es extra√±o que lo extra√±o<br>
asuste un poco<br>
y asusta mucho<br>
que asuste tanto<br>
el quebrar hipocres√≠as<br>
y el deshacer eslogans<br>
que es una forma de ser<br>
sin ser en realidad lo que se es.<br>
En cierta forma igual<br>
a cualquier tierra del mundo.<br>
Se encumbran conceptos de patria<br>
y la patria es simple:<br>
un lugar donde alguien te conoce<br>
y a lo mejor te quiere.<br>
Aqu√≠ en esta tierra<br>
pronto tendr√°s lugar,<br>
alguien que te conozca<br>
y a lo mejor te quiera.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to this wise man [Nordenski√∂ld], the indians placed in their tombs
only quipus with numbers that for them had a magical value, expressing them
not in a direct way but through others that included them or their multiples,
and trying to make them coincide with the resulting numbers of calculations
from consulting the stars. [...].
The purpose that lead the indians to such practice was to entertain, with
this complicated "rebus", the evil spirits, who would struggle to untie the
knots in the strings and find this magical numbering [...].</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mapillary.com/">Mapillary</a> por primera vez ha lanzado un reto
global de captura de im√°genes. Desde el 11 de diciembre hasta el 31 de enero,
San Jos√© estar√° participando en
<a href="https://blog.mapillary.com/community/2017/06/29/completethemap-challenges.html">#CompletetheMap</a>
para completar su mapa capturando fotos con las herramientas de Mapillary,
junto a ciudades, pueblos y lugares remotos de todo el mundo.</p>
<p>Mapillary es una plataforma colaborativa que permite visualizar el mundo con
fotos a nivel de la calle. Las fotos son contribuidas por una amplia gama de
fuentes, incluyendo personas, gobiernos, agencias humanitarias y empresas de
mapas. Las fotos luego son procesadas por Mapillary para extraer datos
geogr√°ficos como l√≠mites de velocidad, giros prohibidos, ciclov√≠as y la
cantidad de vegetaci√≥n en un lugar. Por estas razones, se ha convertido en una
herramienta popular en la comunidad de OpenStreetMap, un proyecto de c√≥digo
abierto que se basa en personas editoras voluntarias para crear el mapa del
mundo.</p>

<p>Algunos usos pr√°cticos de estos datos incluyen el an√°lisis de la infraestructura
para bicicletas a lo largo de una ciudad, reducci√≥n de riesgos antes y despu√©s de
desastres, movilidad urbana, y puntos de reuni√≥n. #CompletetheMap viene a impulsar
este estilo r√°pido de recolecci√≥n de datos en un √°rea espec√≠fica. La idea
de #CompletetheMap es simple. El √°rea seleccionada se divide en zonas, y personas
miembros de la comunidad local colaboran para capturar im√°genes en cada zona.
Conforme el porcentaje de fotos de calles y caminos aumenta, la zona cambia de
color de rojo a naranja, y de naranja a verde.</p>
<p>El reto #CompletetheMap empez√≥ en mayo de este a√±o y ya se ha realizado en ciudades
como
<a href="https://mapillary.github.io/mapillary_greenhouse/ctm/brasilia/">Brasilia</a>,
<a href="https://mapillary.github.io/mapillary_greenhouse/challenge/moscow/">Mosc√∫</a>,
<a href="https://mapillary.github.io/mapillary_greenhouse/challenge/berlin/">Berl√≠n</a> y
<a href="https://mapillary.github.io/mapillary_greenhouse/challenge/ottawa/">Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>Cada una de estas ciudades ha respondido en su propia forma, reuniendo a la
comunidad y mostrando la gran cantidad de datos que incluso un peque√±o grupo de
personas puede recolectar. Brasilia se ha concentrado en caracter√≠sticas de
calles y puntos de inter√©s. Mosc√∫ se reuni√≥ para capturar fotos de algunas de
las carreteras m√°s nuevas alrededor del centro de la ciudad. Berl√≠n, la primera
en participar en el reto de #CompletetheMap, ayud√≥ a prepararlo recolectando
muchas de las calles m√°s peque√±as y rutas peatonales. Luego est√° Ottawa,
un #CompletetheMap centrado en infraestructura para bicicletas. En este reto,
20 personas lograron recolectar medio mill√≥n de im√°genes y casi 2000 km de
cobertura nueva.</p>
<p>El reto global le permite a cualquier persona seguir su progreso relativo a
otras alrededor del mundo, recolectando fotos en un √°rea de 50 km2. Las
participantes pueden ganar aumentando los km de nuevas rutas que capturan, la
cantidad de im√°genes que toman, y el n√∫mero de participantes que se unen para
ayudarles.</p>

<p>Actualmente, 23 ciudades de 17 pa√≠ses se han registrado para el #CompletetheMap
global.</p>
<p>Todo lo que se necesita para colaborar es un tel√©fono celular. Participe en el
reto descargando la aplicaci√≥n de Mapillary y tomando fotos de las calles por
las que viaja. Una vez que se conecte a una red wifi, suba las im√°genes y
v√©alas aparecer en Mapillary.com.</p>

<p>I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer. A big part of my job is to find problems,
then make sure that they are fixed and <em>automated</em> so they don't regress. If I
do my job well, then our process will identify new and potential problems early
<em>without manual intervention</em> from anybody in the team. It's like trying to
automate myself, everyday, until I'm no longer needed and have to jump to
another project.</p>
<p>However, as we work in the project, it's unavoidable that many small manual
tasks accumulate on my hands. This happens because I set up the continuous
integration infrastructure, so I'm the one who knows more about it and have
easier access, or because I'm the one who requested access to the build farm
so I'm the one with the password, or because I configured the staging
environment and I'm the only one who knows the details. This is a great way
to achieve job security, but it doesn't lead us to higher quality. It's a job
half done, and it's terribly boring to be a bottleneck and a silo of
information about testing and the release process. All of these tasks should be
shared by the whole team, as with all the other tasks in the project.</p>
<p>There are two problems. First, most of these tasks involve delicate credentials
that shouldn't be freely shared with everybody. Second, even if the task itself
is simple and quick to execute, it's not very simple to document how to set up
the environment to be able to execute them, nor how to make sure that the right
task is executed in the right moment.</p>
<p>Chatops is how I like to solve all of this. The idea is that every task that
requires manual intervention is implemented in a script that can be executed by
a bot. This bot joins the communication channel where the entire team is
present, and it will execute the tasks and report about their results as a
response to external events that happen somewhere in the project
infrastructure, or as a response to the direct request of a team member in the
channel. The credentials are kept safe, they only have to be shared with the
bot and the permissions can be handled with access control lists or membership
to the channel. And the operative knowledge is shared with all the team,
because they are all listening in the same channel with the bot. This means
that anybody can execute the tasks, and the bot assists them to make it simple.</p>
<p>In snapcraft we started writing our bot not so long ago. It's called snappy-m-o
(<a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/M-O">Microbe Obliterator</a>), and it's written
in python with <a href="http://errbot.io/">errbot</a>. We, of course, packaged it as a
snap so we have automated delivery every time we change it's source code, and
the bot is also autoupdated in the server, so in the chat we are always
interacting with the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>Let me show you how we started it, in case you want to get your own. But let's
call this one Baymax, and let's make a virtual environment with errbot, to
experiment.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Baymax_from_Disney%27s_Big_Hero_6.png"><img alt="drawing of the Baymax bot" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Baymax_from_Disney%27s_Big_Hero_6.png"></a></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ mkdir -p ~/workspace/baymax
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/workspace/baymax
$ sudo apt install python3-venv
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ <span class="nb">source</span> .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install errbot
$ errbot --init
</pre>


<p>The last command will initialize this bot with a super simple plugin, and
will configure it to work in text mode. This means that the bot won't be
listening on any channel, you can just interact with it through the command
line (the ops, without the chat). Let's try it:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ errbot
<span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; !help
All commands
<span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
!tryme - Execute to check <span class="k">if</span> Errbot responds to command.
<span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; !tryme
It works !
&gt;&gt;&gt; !shutdown --confirm
</pre>


<p><code>tryme</code> is the command provided by the example plugin that <code>errbot --init</code>
created. Take a look at the file <code>plugins/err-example/example.py</code>, errbot is
just lovely. In order to define your own plugin you will just need a class that
inherits from <code>errbot.BotPlugin</code>, and the commands are methods decorated with
<code>@errbot.botcmd</code>. I won't dig into how to write plugins, because they have an
amazing
<a href="http://errbot.io/en/latest/user_guide/plugin_development/index.html">documentation about Plugin development</a>.
You can also read the plugins we have in our snappy-m-o, one for
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/snappy-m-o/blob/master/plugins/autopkgtest_github/autopkgtest_github.py">triggering autopkgtests on GitHub pull requests</a>,
and the other for
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/snappy-m-o/blob/master/plugins/snapcraft_github/snapcraft_github.py">subscribing to the results of the pull requests tests</a>.</p>
<p>Let's change the config of Baymax to put it in an IRC chat:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ pip install irc
</pre>


<p>And in the <code>config.py</code> file, set the following values:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">BACKEND = 'IRC'</span>
<span class="err">BOT_IDENTITY = {</span>
<span class="err">    'nickname' : 'baymax-elopio',  # Nicknames need to be unique, so append your own.</span>
<span class="err">                                   # Remember to replace 'elopio' with your nick everywhere</span>
<span class="err">                                   # from now on.</span>
<span class="err">    'server' : 'irc.freenode.net',</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">CHATROOM_PRESENCE = ('#snappy',)</span>
</pre>


<p>Run it again with the errbot command, but this time join the #snappy channel
in irc.freenode.net, and write in there <code>!tryme</code>. It works ! :)</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/errbot/errbot-snap.png"><img alt="screenshot of errbot on IRC" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/errbot/errbot-snap.png"></a></p>
<p>So, this is very simple, but let's package it now to start with the good
practice of continuous delivery before it gets more complicated. As usual, it
just requires a <code>snapcraft.yaml</code> file with all the packaging info and metadata:</p>

<p>And we need to change a few more values in <code>config.py</code> to make sure that the
bot is relocatable, that we can run it in the isolated snap environment, and
that we can add plugins after it has been installed:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="n">BOT_DATA_DIR</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'SNAP_USER_DATA'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre>


<p>One final try, this time from the snap:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ sudo apt install snapcraft
$ snapcraft
$ sudo snap install baymax*.snap --dangerous
$ baymax-elopio
</pre>


<p>And go back to IRC to check.</p>
<p>Last thing would be to push the source code we have just written to a GitHub
repo, and enable the continuous delivery in build.snapcraft.io. Go to your
server and install the bot with <code>sudo snap install baymax-elopio --edge</code>.
Now everytime somebody from your team makes a change in the master repo in
GitHub, the bot in your server will be automatically updated to get those
changes within a few hours without any work from your side.</p>
<p>If you are into chatops, make sure that every time you do a manual task, you
also plan for some time to turn that task into a script that can be executed
by your bot. And get ready to enjoy tons and tons of free time, or just keep
going through those <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft">400 open bugs</a>,
whichever you prefer :)</p>

<p>I love playing with my prototyping boards. Here at Ubuntu we are designing
the <a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/core/get-started">core operating system</a>
to support every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">single-board computer</a>,
and keep it safe, updated and simple. I've learned a lot about physical
computing, but I always have a big problem when my prototype is done, and I
want to deploy it. I am working with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>, a
<a href="http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/">DragonBoard</a>, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard#BeagleBone_Black">BeagleBone</a>. They
are all very different, with different architectures, different pins, onboard
capabilities and peripherals, and they can have different operating systems.
When I started learning about this, I had to write 3 programs that were very
different, if I wanted to try my prototype in all my boards.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/snappy-gobot/20170710_174806.jpg"><img alt="picture of the three different SBCs" src="https://archive.org/download/snappy-gobot/20170710_174806.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then I found <a href="https://gobot.io/">Gobot</a>, a framework for robotics and IoT that
supports my three boards, and many more. With the added benefit that you can
write all the software in the lovely and clean Go language. The Ubuntu store
supports all their architectures too, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2x6mumSrpw">packaging Go projects with snapcraft</a>
is super simple. So we can combine all of this to make a single snap package
that with the help of Gobot will work on every board, and deploy it to all the
users of these boards through the snaps store.</p>
<p>Let's dig into the code with a very simple example to blink an LED, first
for the Raspberry PI only.</p>

<p>In there you will see some of the Gobot concepts. There's an adaptor for the
board, a driver for the specific device (in this case the LED), and a robot
to control everything. In this program, there are only two things specific to
the Raspberry Pi: the adaptor and the name of the GPIO pin (<code>"7"</code>).</p>
<p><a href="https://ia801502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_214428.ogv"><img alt="picture of the Raspberry Pi prototype" src="https://ia601502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_214439.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It works nicely in one of the boards, but let's extend the code a little to
support the other two.</p>

<p>We are basically adding in there a block to select the right adaptor and pin,
depending on which board the code is running. Now we can compile this program,
throw the binary in the board, and give it a try.</p>
<p><a href="https://ia801502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_212605.ogv"><img alt="picture of the Dragonboard prototype" src="https://ia801502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_212602.jpg"></a></p>
<p>But we can do better. If we package this in a snap, anybody with one of the
boards and an operating system that supports snaps can easily install it. We
also open the door to
<a href="https://build.snapcraft.io">continuous delivery</a> and
<a href="http://elopio.net/blog/ipfs-crowdtesting/">crowd testing</a>. And as I said
before, super simple, just put this in the <code>snapcraft.yaml</code> file:</p>

<p>To build the snap, here is a cool trick thanks to the work that
<a href="http://www.twotoasts.de/index.php/2017/06/how-to-support-cross-compilation-in-plugins/">kalikiana</a>
recently added to snapcraft. I'm writing this code in my development machine,
which is amd64. But the raspberry pi and beaglebone are armhf, and the
dragonboard is arm64; so I need to cross-compile the code to get binaries
for all the architectures:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">snapcraft --target-arch=armhf</span>
<span class="err">snapcraft clean</span>
<span class="err">snapcraft --target-arch=arm64</span>
</pre>


<p>That will leave two .snap files in my working directory that then I can upload
to the store with <code>snapcraft push</code>. Or I can just push the code to GitHub and
let <a href="https://build.snapcraft.io">build.snapcraft.io</a> to take care of building
and pushing for me.</p>
<p>Here is the source code for this simple example:
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/gobot-blink">https://github.com/elopio/gobot-blink</a></p>
<p>Of course, Gobot supports many more devices that will let you build complex
robots. Just take a look at the
<a href="https://gobot.io/documentation/">documentation in the Gobot site</a>, and at the
<a href="https://gobot.io/documentation/guides/snapcraft/">guide about deployable packages with Gobot and snapcraft</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ia801502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_233319.ogv"><img alt="picture of the BeagleBone prototype" src="https://ia601502.us.archive.org/32/items/snappy-gobot/20170710_233317.jpg"></a></p>
<p>If you have one of the boards I'm using here to play, give it a try:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="err">sudo snap install gobot-blink-elopio --edge --devmode</span>
<span class="err">sudo gobot-blink-elopio</span>
</pre>


<p>Now my experiments will be to try make the snap more secure, with strict
confinement. If you have any questions or want to help, we have a
<a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/write-your-robots-in-go-with-gobot-and-distribute-the-software-as-snaps/1086">topic in the forum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> offers a great continuous integration
service for the projects hosted on GitHub. With it, you can run tests, deliver
artifacts and deploy applications every time you push a commit, on pull requests, after they are merged, or with some other frequency.</p>
<p>Last week Travis CI
<a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-06-21-trusty-updates-2017-Q2-launch">updated the Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) machines</a>
that run your tests and deployment steps. This update came with a nice surprise for everybody
working to deliver software to Linux users, because it is now possible to
install <a href="https://snapcraft.io">snaps</a> in Travis!</p>
<p>I've been excited all week telling people about all the doors that this opens;
but if you have been following my adventures in the Ubuntu world, by now you
can probably guess that I'm mostly thinking about all the potential this has
for automated testing. For the automation of user acceptance tests.</p>
<p>User acceptance tests are executed from the point of view of the user, with
your software presented as a black box to them. The tests can only interact
with the software through the entry points you define for your users. If it's
a CLI application, then the tests will call commands and subcommands and check
the outputs. If it's a website or a desktop application, the tests will click
things, enter text and check the changes on this GUI. If it's a service with
an HTTP API, the tests will make requests and check the responses. On these
tests, the closer you can get to simulate the environment and behaviour of your
real users, the better.</p>
<p>Snaps are great for the automation of user acceptance tests because they are
immutable and they bundle all their dependencies. With this we can make sure
that your snap will work the same on any of the operating systems and
architectures that support snaps. The <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/snapd">snapd</a> service takes care of hiding
the differences and presenting a consistent execution environment for the snap.
So, getting a green execution of these tests in the Trusty machine of Travis is
a pretty good indication that it will work on all the active releases of
Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and even on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about, obviously using my
favourite snap called IPFS. There is
<a href="http://elopio.net/blog/ipfs-crowdtesting/">more information about IPFS in my previous post</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the most simple snap because they use their own build tool to get the
go dependencies and compile; but it's also not too complex. If you are new to
snaps and want to understand every detail of this file, or you want to package
your own project, the
<a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/create-first-snap">tutorial to create your first snap</a>
is a good place to start.</p>
<p>What's important here is that if you run <code>snapcraft</code> using the snapcraft.yaml file above, you
will get the IPFS snap. If you install that snap, then you can test it from the
point of view of the user. And if the tests work well, you can push it to the
edge channel of the Ubuntu store to start the crowdtesting with your community.</p>
<p>We can automate all of this with Travis. The <code>snapcraft.yaml</code> for the project
must be already in the GitHub repository, and we will add there a <code>.travis.yml</code>
file. They have
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/">good docs to prepare your Travis account</a>.
First, let's see what's required to build the snap:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nl">sudo</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">required</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nl">services</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">docker</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="nl">script</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">docker</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">run</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pwd</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">:$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pwd</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pwd</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">snapcore</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">snapcraft</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sh</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"apt update &amp;&amp; snapcraft"</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre>


<p>For now, we build the snap in a docker container to keep things simple. We have
work in progress to be able to install snapcraft in Trusty as a snap, so soon
this will be even nicer running everything directly in the Travis machine.</p>
<p>This previous step will leave the packaged .snap file in the current directory.
So we can install it adding a few more steps to the Travis script:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">[...]</span>

<span class="na">script:</span>
  <span class="na">- docker [...]</span>
  <span class="na">- sudo apt install --yes snapd</span>
  <span class="na">- sudo snap install *.snap --dangerous</span>
</pre>


<p>And once the snap is installed, we can run it and check that it works as expected.
Those checks are our automated user acceptance test. IPFS has a CLI
client, so we can just run commands and verify outputs with grep. Or we can get
fancier using <a href="https://github.com/kward/shunit2">shunit2</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/">bats</a>. But the basic idea would be to
add to the Travis script something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">[...]</span>

<span class="na">script:</span>
  <span class="k">[...]</span>
  <span class="na">- /snap/bin/ipfs init</span>
  <span class="na">- /snap/bin/ipfs cat /ipfs/QmVLDAhCY3X9P2uRudKAryuQFPM5zqA3Yij1dY8FpGbL7T/readme | grep -z "^Hello and Welcome to IPFS!.*$"</span>
  <span class="na">- [...]</span>
</pre>


<p>If one of those checks fail, Travis will mark the execution as failed and stop
our release process until we fix them. If instead, all of the checks pass, then this version
is good enough to put into the store, where people can take it and run
exploratory tests to try to find problems caused by weird scenarios that we
missed in the automation. To help with that we have the
<code>snapcraft enable-ci travis</code> command, and a tutorial to guide you
step by step
<a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/continuous-snap-delivery-from-travis-ci#0">setting up the continuous delivery from Travis CI</a>.</p>
<p>For the IPFS snap we had for a long time a manual smoke suite, that our amazing
<a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/call-for-testing-ipfs/97">community of testers</a>
have been executing over and over again, every time we want to publish a new
release. I've turned it into
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap/blob/master/tests/smoke_test.sh">a simple bash script</a>
that from now on will be executed frequently by Travis, and will tell us if
there's something wrong before anybody gives it a try manually. With this our
community of testers will have more time to run new and interesting scenarios,
trying to break the application in clever ways, instead of running the same
repetitive steps many times.</p>
<p>Thanks to Travis and snapcraft we no longer have to worry about a big part of
or release process. Continuous integration and delivery can be fully automated,
and we will have to take a look only when something breaks.</p>
<p>As for IPFS, it will keep being my guinea pig to guide new features for
snapcraft and showcase them when ready. It has many more commands that
have to be added to the automated test suite, and it also has a web UI and
an HTTP API. Lots of things to play with! If you would like to help, and
on the way learn about snaps, automation and the decentralized web, please
let me know. You can take a look on my
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap">IPFS snap repo</a> for more details about
testing snaps in Travis, and other tricks for the build and deployment.</p>

<p>Here at Ubuntu we are working hard on the future of free software distribution.
We want developers to release their software to any Linux distro in a way
that's safe, simple and flexible. You can read more about this at
<a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft.io</a>.</p>
<p>This work is extremely fun because we have to work constantly with a wild
variety of free software projects to make sure that the tools we write are
usable and that the workflow we are proposing makes sense to developers and
gives them a lot of value in return. Today I want to talk about one of those
projects: IPFS.</p>
<p>IPFS is the permanent and decentralized web. How cool is that? You get a
peer-to-peer distributed file system where you store and retrieve files. They
have a nice demo <a href="https://ipfs.io/">in their website</a>, and you can give it a
try on Ubuntu Trusty, Xenial or later by running:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ sudo snap install ipfs
</pre>


<p><a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-peers.png"><img alt="screenshot of the IPFS peers" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-peers.png"></a></p>
<p>So, here's one of the problems we are trying to solve. We have millions of users
on the Trusty version of Ubuntu, released during 2014. We also have millions of
users on the Xenial version, released during 2016. Those two versions are stable
now, and following the Ubuntu policies, they will get only security updates for
5 years. That means that it's very hard, almost impossible, for a young project
like IPFS to get into the Ubuntu archives for those releases. There will be no
simple way for all those users to enjoy IPFS, they would have to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive">Personal Package Archive</a>
or install the software from a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)">tarball</a>. Both methods are
complex with high security risks, and both require the users to put a lot of
trust on the developers, more than what they should ever trust anybody.</p>
<p>We are closing the Zesty release cycle which will go out in April, so it's
too late there too. IPFS could make a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)">deb</a>, put it into Debian,
wait for it to sync to Ubuntu, and then it's likely that it will be ready for
the October release. Aside from the fact that we have to wait until October,
there are a few other problems. First, making a deb is not simple. It's not
too hard either, but it requires quite some time to learn to do it right.
Second, I mentioned that IPFS is young, they are on the 0.4.6 version. So, it's
very unlikely that they will want to support this early version for such a long
time as Debian and Ubuntu require. And they are not only young, they are also
fast. They add new features and bug fixes every day and make new releases almost
every week, so they need a feedback loop that's just as fast. A 6 months release
cycle is way too slow. That works nicely for some kinds of free software
projects, but not for one like IPFS.</p>
<p>They have been kind enough to let me play with their project and use it as a
test subject to verify our end-to-end workflow. My passion is testing, so I have
been focusing on continuous delivery to get happy early adopters and constant
feedback about the most recent changes in the project.</p>
<p>I started by making a
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap/blob/master/snapcraft.yaml">snapcraft.yaml</a>
file that contains all the metadata required for the snap package. The file is
pretty simple and to make the first version it took me just a couple of minutes,
true story. Since then I've been slowly improving and updating it with small
changes. If you are interested in doing the same for your project, you can read
<a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/create-first-snap">the tutorial to create a snap</a>.</p>
<p>I built and tested this snap locally on my machines. It worked nicely, so I
pushed it to the edge channel of the Ubuntu Store. Here, the snap is not visible
on user searches, only the people who know about the snap will be able to
install it. I told a couple of my friends to give it a try, and they came back
telling me how cool IPFS was. Great choice for my first test subject, no
doubt.</p>
<p>At this point, following the pace of the project by manually building and
pushing new versions to the store was too demanding, they go too fast. So, I
started working on continuous delivery by translating everything I did manually
into scripts and hooking them to travis-ci. After a few days, it got pretty
fancy, take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap">the github repo of the IPFS snap</a> if you
are curious. Every day, a new version is packaged from the latest state of the
master branch of IPFS and it is pushed to the edge channel, so we have a constant
flow of new releases for hardcore early adopters. After they install IPFS from
the edge channel once, the package will be automatically updated in their
machines every day, so they don't have to do anything else, just use IPFS as
they normally would.</p>
<p>Now with this constant stream of updates, me and my two friends were not enough
to validate all the new features. We could never be sure if the project was
stable enough to be pushed to the stable channel and make it available to the
millions and millions of Ubuntu users out there.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Ubuntu community is huge, and they are very nice people. It was
time to use the wisdom of the crowds. I invited the most brave of them to keep
the snap installed from edge and I defined a simple pipeline that leads to the
stable release using the four available channels in the Ubuntu store:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a revision is tagged in the IPFS master repo, it is automatically pushed
   to edge channel from travis, just as with any other revision.</li>
<li>Travis notifies me about this revision.</li>
<li>I install this tagged revision from edge, and run a super quick test to make
   sure that the IPFS server starts.</li>
<li>If it starts, I push the snap to the beta channel.</li>
<li>With a couple of my friends, we run a
   <a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#file-ipfs-smoke-tests-md">suite of smoke tests</a>.</li>
<li>If everything goes well, I push the snap to the candidate channel.</li>
<li>I notify the community of Ubuntu testers about a new version in the candidate
   channel. This is were the magic of crowd testing happens.</li>
<li>The Ubuntu testers run the smoke tests in all their machines, which gives us
   the confidence we need because we are confirming that the new version works
   on different platforms, distros, distro releases, countries, network
   topologies, you name it.</li>
<li>This candidate release is left for some time in this channel, to let the
   community run thorough exploratory tests, trying to find weird usage
   combinations that could break the software.</li>
<li>If the tag was for a final upstream release, the community also runs
   <a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#file-ipfs-update-tests-md">update tests</a>
   to make sure that the users with the stable snap installed will get this new
   version without issues.</li>
<li>After all the problems found by the community have been resolved or at least
   acknowledged and triaged as not blockers, I move the snap from candidate
   to the stable channel.</li>
<li>All the users following the stable channel will automatically get a very well
   tested version, thanks to the community who contributed with the testing and
   accepted a higher level of risk.</li>
<li>And we start again, the never-ending cycle of making free software :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's go back to the discussion about trust. Debian and Ubuntu, and most of
the other distros, rely on maintainers and distro developers to package and
review every change on the software that they put in their archives. That is
a lot of work, and it slows down the feedback loop a lot, as we have seen. In
here we automated most of the tasks of a distro maintainer, and the new
revisions can be delivered directly to the users without any reviews. So the
users are trusting directly their upstream developers without intermediaries,
but it's very different from the previously existing and unsafe methods. The
code of snaps is installed read-only, very well constrained with access only to
their own safe space. Any other access needs to be declared by the snap, and
the user is always in control of which access is permitted to the application.</p>
<p>This way upstream developers can go faster but without exposing their users to
unnecessary risks. And they just need a simple snapcraft.yaml file and to define
their own continuous delivery pipeline, on their own timeline.</p>
<p>By removing the distro as the intermediary between the developers and their
users, we are also making a new world full of possibilities for the Ubuntu
community. Now they can collaborate constantly and directly with upstream
developers, closing this quick feedback loop. In the future we will tell our
children of the good old days when we had to report a bug in Ubuntu, which
would be copied to Debian, then sent upstream to the developers, and after 6
months, the fix would arrive. It was fun, and it lead us to where we are today,
but I will not miss it at all.</p>
<p>Finally, what's next for IPFS? After this experiment we got more than 200
unique testers and almost 300 test installs. I now have great confidence on
this workflow, new revisions were delivered on time, existing Ubuntu
testers became new IPFS contributors and I now can safely recommend IPFS
users to install the stable snap. But there's still plenty of work ahead.
There are still manual steps in the pipeline that can be scripted, the smoke
tests can be automated to leave more free time for exploratory testing, we can
release also to armhf and arm64 architectures to get IPFS into the
<a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/internet-of-things">IoT world</a>, and well, of course the
developers are not stopping, they keep releasing new interesting features. As I
said, plenty of opportunities for us as distro contributors.</p>
